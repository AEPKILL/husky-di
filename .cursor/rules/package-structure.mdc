# Package Structure Guidelines

## Core Package (packages/core)

- **Purpose**: Provide core functionality and utility functions
- **Exports**: Support both ESM and CommonJS formats
- **Types**: Must provide complete TypeScript type definitions
- **Testing**: Use Vitest for unit testing

## React Package (packages/react)

- **Purpose**: Provide React component library
- **Component Guidelines**:
  - Use functional components and Hooks
  - Support TypeScript type-safe props
  - Provide Storybook documentation
  - Include complete test coverage

## Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo to wrap pure components
- Use useMemo and useCallback appropriately
- Avoid creating new objects in render functions
