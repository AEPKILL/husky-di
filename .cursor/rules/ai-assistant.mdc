# AI Assistant Guidelines

When generating or modifying code:

- Always read existing code patterns before making changes
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase style
- Prefer refactoring over rewriting when possible
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
- Generate complete, working code that follows all project rules
- Include proper error handling and edge cases
- Write tests for new functionality

## File Operations

- Always read existing files before modifying them
- Use absolute paths when possible for file operations
- Check for existing implementations before creating new ones
- Preserve existing code structure and patterns
- Update related files (tests, exports, documentation) when adding new features

## Code Modification Best Practices

- Make minimal, focused changes
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly requested to change
- Update tests when modifying behavior
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes clearly
